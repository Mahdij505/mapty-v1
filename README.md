**Mapty â€“ Workout Tracker with Map Integration**  
This is a JavaScript project from Jonas Schmedtmannâ€™s course. Mapty is a simple workout tracker that lets users log running and cycling workouts. It uses the browser's geolocation API and Leaflet.js to display workout locations on an interactive map. Each workout shows relevant details like distance, duration, and pace or speed, making it easy to visualize and track your fitness activity.
